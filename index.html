						<p>I've played guitar since I first moved to Nasvhille in 2002. I played with a band for several years, then went on to play with other artists on the road and in the studio. Since getting married in 2006 I decided to take less of the traveling gigs and spend more time in Nashville. I still will play an occasional gig or spend some time doing studio work. However, most of my playing now is recreational as I have pursued other work.</p>

						<p>Xacttone Solutions (XTS) is a company that manufactures guitar pedals and performs system integration. I began working with XTS stuffing circuit boards to help with the pedal production. I then began to get involved assembling pedal boards and rigs for many artists and Nashville session players, including Keith Urban, Peter Frampton, John Oates, and many more.</p>
